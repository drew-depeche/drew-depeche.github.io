        <p class="about">
            <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
            Drew Depeche is an art enthusiast currently exploring various media with the sole interest of exploiting them to achieve concrete, comprehensible visuals of abstract ideas and concepts.
            While Depeche is studying a B.F.A in Digital Arts at the University of Malta, he also holds an interest in various other topics that he integrates within his work.
            Psychology, philosophy, cinematography and buddhism, are
            to say the least a few of his obsessive interests that seem to be reoccuring motifs in his work.
