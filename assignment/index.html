            Within the DGA1020 unit, a particular assignment proved to be pivotal in my
            learning process in order to properly understand the fundamentals of lighting.
            With particular interest to fill, back and key light, the above objects were lit in the scene
            following the theoretic rules of the light placement. Furthermore, experimentation was done
            in regards of the shutterspeed to observe the difference the motion blur in slow shutter speed
             and the absence of it in fast shutterspeed.
